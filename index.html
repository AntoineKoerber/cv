            <br>
            <p>I am a self-taught Software Developer. I am 22 years old, currently searching for a job
            as a Software Developer in Basel, Switzerland. I have had professional experiences in various domains such as
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoine-koerber-027342178/">accounting, office management and gardener</a>. These experiences taught me that I needed to keep on searching for
            the domain that truly drives me. It is with that mindset that I found out about programming.
            I started learning how to code through online classes in October 2022. I have accumulated about 200 hours of
            coding (without counting the "listening and watching <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code">coding classes</a>" hours). And I can comfortably say that
            I love it. Coding allows me to be creative, solve problems and find ways to improve my day to day life.
